  "text": "What is Atlan? | Atlan Documentation\nSkip to main content\nOn this page\nWe are a modern data workspace that makes collaboration among diverse users like business, analysts, and engineers easier, increasing efficiency and agility in data projects.\nWe started out as a data team, solving social good problems using data science. We built Atlan for ourselves over the course of 200 data projects, which included India's national data platform used by the prime minister and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations.\nAtlan helped us build India's national data platform with an 8-member team, making it the fastest project of its kind to go live in just 12 months  - instead of the projected three years.\nWhy we built Atlan\nâ\nData teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, and business users. Diverse people with diverse tools and skillsets mean diverse DNAs. All of it led to chaos, which made our Slack channels look like this...\nWe call this \"collaboration overheard\"\nâ\nWe knew we couldn't scale like this, there had to be a better way. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years and across 200 data projects to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. We call this\nDataOps\n.\nHow Atlan helps data teams\nâ\nWith Atlan, analyst teams at Unilever have shipped 100+ additional data projects per quarter, while data science teams at Samsung have saved 50% of their time.\nCreate self-service ecosystems by reducing dependencies\nâ\nAtlan makes all your data assets easily discoverable. No more Slack messages like \"Where's that dataset?\" or long email threads for approvals. With Atlan, you can simply Cmd+K your way to the right data asset.\nKey capabilities\n:\ndiscovery and search\n,\nVisual Query Builder\n,\nsaved queries\n,\nREADMEs\nImprove the agility of your data team\nâ\nData practitioners spend 30-50% of their time finding and understanding data. Atlan cuts that time by 95%. Your data team will be shipping 2-3 times more projects in no time.\nKey capabilities\n: visibility of\ndata quality\ntests and observability alerts,\nautomated lineage\n,\nAtlan AI\nPromote governance and a sustainable data culture\nâ\nDon't lose sleep trying to figure out if your sensitive data is secure. Build ecosystems of trust, make your team happy, and let Atlan manage governance and security behind the scenes.\nKey capabilities\n:\ntag sensitive data\n,\ngranular access control\n,\ndata products\nWhy we built Atlan\nHow Atlan helps data teams",
