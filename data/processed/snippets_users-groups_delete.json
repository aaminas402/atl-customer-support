For this you can use static methods provided by the\nAtlanUser\nand\nAtlanGroup\nclasses.\nAll delete operations are permanent\nAll delete operations on users and groups are permanent, hard-deletes. There is no way to archive (soft-delete) users and groups.\nDelete a group\nÂ¶\n0.0.13\n1.3.3\n4.0.0\nFor example, to delete a group:\nJava\nPython\nKotlin\nGo\nRaw REST API\nDelete a group\n1\nAtlanGroup\n.\ndelete\n(\nclient\n,\n\"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\"\n);\n// (1)\nTo delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the\nAtlanGroup.delete()\nmethod. Because this operation will remove the group from Atlan, you must\nprovide it an\nAtlanClient\nthrough which to connect to the tenant.\nDelete a group\n1\n2\n3\n4\nfrom\npyatlan.client.atlan\nimport\nAtlanClient\nclient\n=\nAtlanClient\n()\nclient\n.\ngroup\n.\npurge\n(\n\"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\"\n)\n# (1)\nTo delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the\ngroup.purge()\nmethod.\nDelete a group\n1\nAtlanGroup\n.\ndelete\n(\nclient\n,\n\"e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7\"\n)\n// (1)\nTo delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the\nAtlanGroup.delete()\nmethod. Because this operation will remove the group from Atlan, you must\nprovide it an\nAtlanClient\nthrough which to connect to the tenant.\nDelete a group\n1\nctx\n.\nGroupClient\n.\nPurge\n(\n\"a99f50bc-46bf-4d08-a987-3411ef5cfc33\"\n)\n// (1)\nTo delete a group, you must specify its GUID and can simply call the\nGroupClient.Purge()\nmethod.\nPOST /api/service/groups/e79cb8eb-2bb6-4821-914c-f8dfd21fedc7/delete\n1\n// (1)\nAll details are in the URL itself.\nGroup ID in the URL\nNote that you must provide the unique ID (GUID) of the group to delete it.\nDelete a user\nÂ¶\n0.0.16\nIrreversible operation that requires admin user's bearer token\nDeleting a user is irreversible â€” be certain you want to fully remove the user and all references to the user (their ownership of assets, workflows, and so on) before running this operation. This operation can only be done using an admin user's bearer token, not an API token.\nGo\nDelete a user\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nresponse\n,\natlanErr\n:=\nctx\n.\nUserClient\n.\nRemoveUser\n(\n\"test-user-1\"\n,\n\"test-user-2\"\n,\n\"test-user-3\"\n,\n)\n// (1)\nif\natlanErr\n!=\nnil\n{\nlogger\n.\nLog\n.\nErrorf\n(\n\"Error deleting user: %v\"\n,\natlanErr\n)\n// (2)\n}\nCall the\nctx.UserClient.RemoveUser()\nmethod with the following parameters :\nuserName\n: The username of the user to be removed (\n\"test-user-1\"\nin this example).\ntransferToUserName\n: The username of the user to whom the assets should be transferred (\n\"test-user-2\"\nin this example).\nwfCreatorUserName (optional)\n: The username of the workflow creator (\n\"test-user-3\"\nin this example). If\nnil\n, it defaults to\ntransferToUserName\n.\nIf an error occurs during the deletion, it will be logged.\nNote:\nA user can only be removed if they have fewer permissions than an admin. An admin cannot remove another admin.\n2022-12-28\n2025-02-25\nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nThanks for your feedback!
