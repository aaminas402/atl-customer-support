So a glossary must first exist, before you can create a term or category. This also means that if you delete a glossary, all of the terms and categories within that glossary are also deleted.\nNote as well that terms are\nnot\ncontained within categories. Categories are simply a mechanism to organize terms in Atlan. This means that deleting a category will\nnot\ndelete the terms related to it.\nerDiagram\nGlossary ||--o{ GlossaryCategory : contains\nGlossary ||--o{ GlossaryTerm : contains\nEach glossary object\nmostly\nbehaves like other assets in Atlan. You can\ncreate\n,\nretrieve\n,\nupdate\n,\ndelete\n,\nrestore\n,\nview history\n,\nsearch\n, and\ncombine operations\nusing the same patterns as for any other asset.\nUnique characteristics of glossary objects\nThere are, however, a few points that are unique to glossary objects compared to other asset types:\nThe\nqualifiedNames\nof all glossary objects are a hashed string. This is not human-readable. All other asset types have qualifiedNames that are human-readable. We have provided\nhelper methods\nspecifically for retrieval of glossary assets by their human-readable names.\nWhen\nupdating\na contained glossary object (term or category), you must provide details about the parent glossary of that object. You can update all other asset types without re-specifying their parent object.\nAs a result, the\ncreator()\nand\nupdater()\nbuilder methods for terms and categories require extra parameters to specify the glossary.\nThe other difference that exists in interacting with glossaries is the common need to\ntraverse\ntheir hierarchy of categories.\n2022-12-02\n2024-10-01\nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nThanks for your feedback!
