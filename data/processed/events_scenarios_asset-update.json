The details in this event cover the related asset.\nMore details\nParent-child relationships\nUnlike with asset creation, typically the parent-child relationship already exists when an asset is updated and thus does not need to be redefined. So it is rare that you would see Atlan emitting\nENTITY_UPDATE\nevents for parent-child relationships during an asset update.\nPeer-to-peer relationships\nFor example, specifying a term to link to a column when updating the column.\nAn\nENTITY_UPDATE\nevent will be emitted for the term that is specified.\nNote: this means a single asset creation (single\nENTITY_CREATE\nevent) could emit any number of\nENTITY_UPDATE\nevents.\nNote that events are only emitted when an asset is\nactually\nupdated. Since Atlan's\nsave operation\nis idempotent, when no changes are actually sent in the payload it behaves as a NOOP â€” the asset is not actually changed or updated. In these cases, no events are emitted, either.\nâ†©\n2022-11-07\n2024-10-01\nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nThanks for your feedback!
