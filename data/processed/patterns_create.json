Connections are the basis for access control, so you must create (or use an existing) connection before you can create any other assets.\nYou must then create each subsequent level of the data asset's structure(s) in parent-first order.\nYou can bulk-create assets at the same level\nWhile parent assets must exist before creating child assets, you can create multiple assets at the same level all at the same time.\nExample: relational database structure\nYou must first create a\nConnection\n(or decide to reuse an existing one).\nYou can then create any number\nDatabase\ns within that connection, at the same time.\nYou can then create any number of\nSchema\ns within any of those databases, at the same time.\nYou can then create any number of\nTable\ns or\nView\ns within any of those schemas, at the same time.\nAnd you can then finally create any number of\nColumn\ns within any of those tables or views, at the same time.\n2023-04-12\n2025-07-29\nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nThanks for your feedback!
