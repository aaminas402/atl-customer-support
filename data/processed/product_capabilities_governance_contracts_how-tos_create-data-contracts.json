As a powerful tool for data management, data contracts can help you standardize contractual obligations between data producers and consumers, organize your assets with embeddable contract metadata, and enforce them with data quality rules.\nIn Atlan, you can directly add a data contract to supported assets and provide helpful context to your downstream users.\nFor a data contract to help build trust in your assets, it should be:\nTemplatized and easily comprehensible   -  use Atlan's YAML contract template to create standardized contracts and push to Atlan.\nVersion-controlled   -  continuously validate and monitor your data contracts either in runtime or real-time.\nEmbeddable   -  embed the contract as metadata for a supported asset.\nEnforceable   -  enforce your contracts with data quality rules.\nExtensible   -  identify new specifications, generate new versions, and then compare and contrast them.\nDid you know?\nYou can\ncreate webhooks for data contracts\nand receive notifications for when a contract is added or updated to a URL of your choice.\nSupported asset types\nâ\nYou can create data contracts for the following asset types:\nTables\nViews\nMaterialized views\nOutput port assets of data products\nSupported asset metadata\nâ\nAtlan maps the following asset metadata properties to it contract properties:\nMetadata property\nContract property\nname\ndataset\ntypeName\ntype\nuserDescription\nor\ndescription\ndescription\nownerUsers\nowner.users\nownerGroups\nowners.groups\ncertificateStatus\ncertification.status\ncertificateStatusMessage\ncertification.message\nannouncementType\nannouncement.type\nannouncementTitle\nannouncement.title\nannouncementMessage\nannouncement.description\nmeaningNames\nterms\nclassificationDef.displayName\ntags.name\nclassifications.propagate\ntags.propagate\nclassifications.restrict_propagation_through_lineage\ntags.restrict_propagation_through_lineage\nclassifications.restrict_propagation_through_hierarchy\ntags.restrict_propagation_through_hierarchy\ncolumn.name\ncolumns.name\ncolumn.userDescription\nor\ncolumn.description\ncolumns.description\ncolumn.dataType\ncolumns.data_type\ncolumn.isPrimary\ncolumns.primary\n!column.isNullable\ncolumns.required\ncolumn.precision\ncolumns.precision\ncolumn.numericScale\ncolumns.scale\ntags\non column\ncolumns.tags\ncolumn.meaningNames\ncolumns.terms\ncustom metadata\n(CM)\ncustom_metadata.<CM>\nAdd a data contract to an asset\nâ\nWho can do this?\nAny non-guest user with\nedit access to an asset's metadata\ncan create, deploy, and manage data contracts. This only includes\nadmin and member users\nin Atlan.\nTo add a data contract to an asset, you can either:\nCreate a contract directly in Atlan from the\nContracts\ntab of the asset profile. You can create and maintain data contracts as easily as editing a word document.\nUse Atlan CLI to import an existing contract from your local machine to Atlan directly or through a CI/CD pipeline.\nAtlan CLI\nis a command-line tool that you can download directly from Atlan to your local machine to create and push data contracts to Atlan. Once you have published the contract, you can also\nsync metadata\nfrom a contract to the governed asset in Atlan.\nOnce created, you will be able to monitor and manage your data contracts in Atlan.\nTo add a data contract:\nFrom the left menu of any screen in Atlan, click\nAssets\n.\n(Optional) From the\nFilters\nmenu on the left, click\nProperties\nand then click\nHas contract\n. Click\nNo\nto filter for assets without a contract.\nFrom the\nAssets\npage, select an asset to open the asset sidebar.\nIn the left\nOverview\nsidebar, click\nAdd contract\n.\nIn the\nContract\ntab of the asset profile, you can either:\nClick\nCreate contract\nto create a draft contract directly in Atlan based on asset metadata.\nClick\nImport contract\nto use\nAtlan CLI\nto import an existing contract from your local environment to Atlan. You will first need to install and connect Atlan CLI and then push the contract to Atlan. Refer to our\ndeveloper documentation\nto complete the steps.\n(Optional) Click the\nEdit\nbutton to edit the contract.\nCongrats on adding a data contract in Atlan! ð\nView a data contract\nâ\nTo view a data contract:\nFrom the left menu of any screen in Atlan, click\nAssets\n.\nFrom the\nAssets\npage, select an asset to open the asset sidebar.\nFrom the left\nOverview\nsidebar, click\nView contract\nto navigate to the\nContract\nÂ tab in the asset profile.\n(Optional) In the\nContract\ntab, you can view the contract specifications for your asset in a YAML format.
