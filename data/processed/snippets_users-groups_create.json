Note that this must be specified as a string within an array.\nProvide an internal name for the group.\nMust follow certain constraints\nThe internal name for the group must be unique, all lowercase, and include only alphanumeric characters and the\n_\n(no spaces or special characters).\nCreate a user\nÂ¶\nTo create a user, what you're really doing is inviting them. The users will need to verify their email address to activate their account, and will be able to specify their own password as part of that process.\n0.0.13\n2.0.4\n4.0.0\nTo invite a user:\nJava\nPython\nKotlin\nGo\nRaw REST API\nInvite a user\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nAtlanUser\nuser\n=\nAtlanUser\n.\ncreator\n(\n\"someone@somewhere.org\"\n,\n// (1)\n\"$member\"\n)\n// (2)\n.\nbuild\n();\n// (3)\nuser\n.\ncreate\n(\nclient\n);\n// (4)\nWhen inviting a user, you must specify at least their email address...\n...and the workspace role you want to give that user (one of\n$guest\n,\n$member\n, or\n$admin\n).\nLike other builder patterns, you build the object to make it ready for creation.\nTo actually invite the user to Atlan, call the\ncreate()\nmethod on the built object.
