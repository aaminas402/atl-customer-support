It connects internal systems with Atlan SaaS while keeping sensitive data protected and doesnât require inbound connectivity. Running within an organizationâs controlled environment, the Secure Agent ensures compliance with security policies and automates metadata processing.\nFigure 1:\nThe Secure Agent runs in the customer environment and acts as a gateway.\nKey capabilities\nâ\nThe Secure Agent is designed for secure, scalable, and efficient metadata extraction.\nSecurity-first architecture\nâ\nRuns entirely within the organization's infrastructure, preventing secrets from leaving its boundary.\nUses outbound, encrypted communication to interact with Atlan SaaS.\nSupports logging and monitoring and integrates with external monitoring systems for auditing and compliance.\nScalable metadata extraction\nâ\nA single deployment of the Agent can connect to multiple source systems.\nSupports multiple concurrent metadata extraction jobs.\nUses Kubernetes-based workloads for efficient resource management.",

The workflow typically involves:\nAtlan triggers a metadata extraction job.\nThe Secure Agent retrieves job details and extracts metadata using source-specific connectors.\nExtracted metadata is shared with Atlan either through cloud storage or direct ingestion.\nAtlan workflows process the extracted metadata and publish the assets.\nLogs and execution status are sent to Atlan for monitoring and auditing.\nSee also\nâ",
