Alongside each attribute is a listing of the search-specific fields for that attribute and its type.\nField types\nÂ¶\nWe use the following conventions to delineate the nuances of how different attributes are indexed, and what this means for searching. Note that in the SDKs, every field that exists in Atlan is enumerated. This avoids you needing to remember the exact name of the field (which can vary depending on how it is indexed, even for the same field) or making typos in strings you send in the query.\nWith the fluent search abstraction, you no longer need to consider how you want to search a particular attribute â€” the underlying implementation is chosen based on the search predicate you use when writing your query. However, for those curious about the mapping, the following are the different index field that we use in Elastic to handle different kinds of searches.\nKeyword\nÂ¶\nKeyword fields\nare used for content that you would usually search using exact values.

This provides the ability to fuzzy-match using synonyms, both plural/singular versions of words, matching one or many words in a multi-word search input, and so on.
