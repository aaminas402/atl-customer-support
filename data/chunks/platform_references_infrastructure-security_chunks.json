A penetration test is an authorized simulated cyber attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data) and strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.\nEvent logging and monitoring\nÂ   -  Atlan has many tools to support monitoring and event logging:\nPrometheus and Grafana for monitoring\nFluent Bit and Loki for event logging\nNetwork access to the control plane\nâ",
